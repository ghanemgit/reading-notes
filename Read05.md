# Data Structure
## Introduction
### Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.
## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
#### Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm. It is a good practice for software engineers to understand in-depth as well.
#### What is Big O Notation, and why does it important?
#### “Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation.”
— Wikipedia’s definition of Big O notation.
### Here we have example about this subject related with Binary tree

## Linked List

#### A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

#### Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.
### Why linked list?
### Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations:
- The size of the arrays is fixed, So we must know the upper limit of the number of elements inadvance.
- Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room exisiting elements have to be shifted
- Deletion is also expensive with arrays until unless some special techniques are used.

### Advantahes over arrays
- Dynamic size.
- Ease of insertion/deletion.
### Drawbacks 
- Random access is not allowed. we have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node.
- extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
