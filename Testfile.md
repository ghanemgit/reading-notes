## Ignoring Markdown formatting
You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

Rendered escaped character

For more information, see Daring Fireball's "Markdown Syntax."

Disabling Markdown rendering
When viewing a Markdown file, you can click  at the top of the file to disable Markdown rendering and view the file's source instead.

Display Markdown as source

Disabling Markdown rendering enables you to use source view features, such as line linking, which is not possible when viewing rendered Markdown files.
