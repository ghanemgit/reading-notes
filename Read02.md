# Packages and import 
### The best word that describe the packages is (folders) folder in windows represnt package in java to sort our classes and methodes.
### And I learned about import java package into a class, we have to use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program. Use import to access built-in and user-defined packages into your java source file so that your class can refer to a class that is in another package by directly using its name common imports to deal with it.

# A guid to java loop
### Java loops are one of the most important things at the beginning of your way to learning this language or programming in general, as get rid of us from writing more and more lines Loops are one of the important tools to accomplish work that needs repetition. Instead of writing several lines, we can write one line and re-execute this line as many times as we want.
### Here I learned about different type of loops in java that type are
- For loop.
- Enhance for loop(for each).
- While loop.
- Do while loop.
### And I am notice the different between while and do while loop, its in do while loop the condtion is after code statemnt(s) and the code excuatuin at least one time.
