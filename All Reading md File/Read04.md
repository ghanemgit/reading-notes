# Object oriented programming
### Object oriented programming is Procedural programming about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

## Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
- Easer and faster to excuete.
- Give a clear blueprint of programm.
- Not needed to Re-write the code you can inherite it.
- Easy to maintanenace of program.

# Classes
### A class is user defind blueprint or prototype from which object are created to represent the set of properities or method that are common to all object of one type.
### You can write method like this
#### class className {
####  //fields, constructor.
####  //method decleration.
####  //This area called class body.
####  }
### Almost we have to initialaizing our object thats done by generate special method call constrictor
### Sometimes the need of inhirit from other class appear we can do that by write the the name of class we want to inhirite from it after (extends) keywords.
### Ok someone saied I want to inhirite only method form certain class ok that done by add (implements) keyword before class name that is prosedures.
### Declaration of class process must include these components:
1) Modifieres (public,private,...etc).
2) Class name (preferred to start by uppercase).
3) The inhiritance and implements class name (If any).
4) Class body (enclosed by braces{}).

# Access Modifier
### Access level modifiers determine whether other classes can use a particular field or invoke a particular method. There are two levels of access control:
- Public: the field is accessible form all classes.
- Private : the field is accessible only within its own class.
### All other type illustrated in Table below

# Methods

### A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

### *Methode signitures: Is part of the method declaration represent the combination of the method name and the parameters list.
## Overloading methods
### Thats mean the methods in same class can carry smae name if it signiture is differ.
### *Note: The compiler automaticly provide constructor with non-parameter if you didint create one.

# Objects

### Is member of java class each object has an identity, a behavior and a state the state of an object is stored in fields(variables) while method display the object behavior.

### Each object has three parts
1- Declaration \<className\> \<objectName\>.
2- Intantiation \<new\> keyword create object.
3- Intialaizing call constructor after \<new\>.

# Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

### -Binary number system is a number system which is based on 2. What exactly is "based on 2"?? Well, you have only two characters ("0" and "1") to define and represent the entire numbers in binary number system.

### -Decimal number system is a number system which is based on 10. What exactly is "based on 10"?? Well, you have 10 characters ("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9") to to define and represent the entire numbers in decimal number system.

### -Hexadecimal number system is a number system which is based on 16. What exactly is "based on 16"?? Well, you have 16 characters ("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F") to to define and represent the entire numbers in Hexadecimal number system.
