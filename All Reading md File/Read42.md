# Ethics in Tech


## Ethics in the workplace, The code I’m still ashamed of
#### I learned from this article that I do not write deceptive or false codes for users, and here when we say deceptive, we mean that it was not created for the apparent purpose of the user, but for other diabolical purposes. Therefore, the software developer must be honest and honorable in his profession, which is the reason for his sustenance, and not write deceptive or false codes. For companies to achieve their goals.

## ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
### Preamble
#### Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the profession.

#### The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur. The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration. Each principle is supplemented by guidelines, which provide explanations to assist computing professionals in understanding and applying the principle.

#### Section 1 outlines fundamental ethical principles that form the basis for the remainder of the Code. Section 2 addresses additional, more specific considerations of professional responsibility. Section 3 guides individuals who have a leadership role, whether in the workplace or in a volunteer professional capacity. Commitment to ethical conduct is required of every ACM member, ACM SIG member, ACM award recipient, and ACM SIG award recipient. Principles involving compliance with the Code are given in Section 4.

#### The Code as a whole is concerned with how fundamental ethical principles apply to a computing professional's conduct. The Code is not an algorithm for solving ethical problems; rather it serves as a basis for ethical decision-making. When thinking through a particular issue, a computing professional may find that multiple principles should be taken into account, and that different principles will have different relevance to the issue. Questions related to these kinds of issues can best be answered by thoughtful consideration of the fundamental ethical principles, understanding that the public good is the paramount consideration. The entire computing profession benefits when the ethical decision-making process is accountable to and transparent to all stakeholders. Open discussions about ethical issues promote this accountability and transparency.

## Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (Short Version)
### PREAMBLE
#### The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction; the clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.

#### Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:

##### 1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

##### 2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

##### 3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

##### 4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

##### 5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

##### 6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

##### 7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

##### 8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
