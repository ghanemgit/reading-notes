# Serverless and Amplify

### Introduction
#### Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity, isn’t it the ideal framework for that project you have been planning since a long time? Well, go ahead do it.

#### Most of the cloud providers have invested heavily in serverless and thats a lot of money; with the given massive promotion and realistic offering you can safely assume serverless to be one of the most used cloud services in upcoming years. Here are some of the currently available cloud services:

### AWS Amplify

#### AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that lets frontend web and mobile developers quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS, with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS services as your use cases evolve. With Amplify, you can configure a web or mobile app backend, connect your app in minutes, visually build a web frontend UI, and easily manage app content outside the AWS console. Ship faster and scale effortlessly—with no cloud expertise needed.

### Advantages of AWS Amplify
#### 1. Free to Start

- AWS Amplify offers many free and impressive levels that offer several advantages and zero costs. You only need to establish a paid level if you reach a high threshold of technical requirements.

#### 2. Development is Easy and UI driven

- Using AWS Amplify for building mobile and internet appliances, offers a simple, fast and modern user interface approach. Here, everything is provided by the out-of-the-box UI component so that you do not have to code one. Likewise, CLI’s design and workflows are also seamless, speeding up the development of the application.

#### 3. Backend Support

- AWS enhances app performance by providing built-in support for backend management,

#### 4. Web-Based Analytics

- AWS Amplify comes with a web-based analysis Dashboard for developers, designers, and project managers, which is extremely useful. It tracks not only users and attributes but also includes enforcement metrics. The analytics are always up to date and can be managed and tracked by teams.

#### 5. Usage-Based Payment

- Like many other paid AWS Services, you only pay for the services you use, the AWS Amplify payment model is very flexible and cost-effective.

### Disadvantages of AWS Amplify
#### 1. Consistent Changes

- This is a platform that is constantly changing, and new changes and features are consistently implemented. This means that an AWS Amplify user always has to stay up to date and explore the platform on a regular basis.

#### 2. Cost

- Since AWS Amplify is a managed service, the end-user is less controlled by the environment and the packages installed which can affect your websites. You must also face other disadvantages of managed services.

#### 3. Traffic Distribution

- When using AWS Amplify, you cannot distribute load balancers. In some cases, it may be a major drawback, such as the management of traffic spikes and latency problems.

#### 4. Higher Learning Curve

- You might know that the time you spare written code is spent on learning the platform when you are a new-born AWS Amplify. Sometimes it is rather difficult for beginners to find the right documentation method, and the various methods and versions can sometimes make navigation difficult.
