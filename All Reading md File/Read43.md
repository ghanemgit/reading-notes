# OSS Contributions


## What is Open Source?
#### In simple words, we can describe an open source project as source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a permissive license.

#### As an example to explain this, let's use a classroom scenario. A teacher can share a document on a platform like Goggle Docs. On this platform students can edit the document and even make copies of their own. But whenever they make edits they have to be approved by the teacher before reflecting on the document again.

#### That's how open source code works: once it's been made public, and you need to add a feature or make changes, the owner has to approve the added changes and publish them for others to see.

#### Most successful open-source projects are a result of contributions from people with all skill levels â€“ and not only coding skills, but also other skills like writing, languages, and so on.

#### Any time someone fixes a typo, adds an alert about a possible compiler warning, fixes a bug, or even adds detailed documentation to a project, progress is made. If we take all these small contributions from different people with different skills and put them together, great things can happen.

## Why you Should Contribute to Open-Source
#### Contributing to open source projects can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience.

#### There are plenty of reasons why you should contribute to an open source project, such as:


- To improve the software you rely on daily.

- To find a mentor if you need one.

- To learn new skills or improve on existing ones.

- To share your skills.

- To gain a much deeper knowledge about the software you're using.

- To build up your reputation and help grow your career.

- Plus, it's fun and gives you personal satisfaction and hey, you never know who is watching, maybe it's your next employer or partner ðŸ™‚.

## Step by Step Guide on How to Contribute to Open Source
#### When we say contributing to open-source, it does not necesarilly mean that you need to know how to code. There are different ways in which you can contribute even if you are a non-coder â€“ but having some coding skills will help you (and the projects) out a lot.

### Some common contributions can be through:

- Adding a description to a project's documentation to elaborate on a certain point, mostly referred to as a README file (check this guide on how to write a [good README File](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/)).
- Giving guidance on a specific project and how to use it.
- Adding sample output to show how the code works.
- Writing in-depth tutorials for the project.
- Adding translation for a project - A good place to start with this might be with the freeCodeCamp's translation program.
- Answering questions about a project (like on Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- You can offer to mentor another contributor.
- You can fix typos and arrange the project's work folder correctly.
