# What Is Stack?
#### Stack is a linear data structure similar to arrays (Links to an external site.) and linked lists (Links to an external site.), restricting the random access of elements. In arrays or linked lists, you can access the items via traversal or random indexing, but the stack data structure doesn't allow it either. A stack can be best understood by seeing it as a container of pieces that can only be stacked on top of each other and removed from that same direction only.

# What Is the Queue?
#### A queue is a linear data structure like a stack having some restrictions on insertion and deletion. In a queue, insertion is performed at one end, and the removal is performed at another or opposite end. 

 
## Representation of Stacks
#### The stack data structure follows Last In First Out or First In Last Out principles to execute its operations. In simpler words, the stack data structure removes the last inserted element at first from the topmost position and the first inserted element at last. That is why this data structure only requires one pointer to remember the element at the top position.

## Representation of Queues
#### The queue in the data structure resembles all these properties of the real-world queue. It follows the First in First Out principle for manipulating the data elements. According to this principle, the element which gets inserted in a list at first gets removed at first. The illustration given below explains the FIFO nature of a queue.
