# The Growth Mindset
## Introduction
### “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point.This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” (Dweck, 2015)

## My notes
- Improving my tech skills makes all the software you build better.
- Push my self outside of my comfort zone.
- Start to using the word "yet" more often.
- Do not forget your passion.
- Think about success and close your eyes from failuer.
